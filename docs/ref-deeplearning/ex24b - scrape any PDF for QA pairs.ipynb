G enerative AI’s impact on \\nproductivity could add trillions \\nof dollars in value to the global economy. Our latest research \\nestimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases we analyzed—by comparison, the United Kingdom’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15 to 40 percent. This estimate would roughly double if we include the impact of embedding generative AI into software that is currently used for other tasks beyond those use cases.\\n2.\\n A\\nbout 75 percent of the value that \\ngenerative AI use cases could deliver falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D . Across 16 business \\nfunctions, we examined 63 use cases in which the technology can address specific business challenges in ways that produce one or more measurable outcomes. Examples include generative AI’s ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales, and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks. \\n3.\\n G\\nenerative AI will have a significant \\nimpact across all industry sectors. Banking, high tech, and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact as a percentage of their revenues from generative AI. Across the banking industry, for example, the technology could deliver value equal to an additional $200 billion to $340 billion annually if the use cases were fully implemented. In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is also significant at $400 billion to $660 billion a year.\\n4.\\n G\\nenerative AI has the potential \\nto change the anatomy of work, augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities.  \\nCurrent generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees’ time today. In contrast, we previously estimated that technology has the potential to automate half of the time employees spend working.\\n1 \\nThe acceleration in the potential for technical automation is largely due to generative AI’s increased ability to understand natural language, which is required for work activities that account for 25 percent of total work time. Thus, generative AI has more impact on knowledge work associated with occupations that have higher wages and educational requirements than on other types of work.\\n5.\\n T\\nhe pace of workforce \\ntransformation is likely to accelerate, given increases in the potential for technical automation.  \\nOur updated adoption scenarios, including technology development, economic feasibility, and diffusion timelines, lead to estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or roughly a decade earlier than in our previous estimates.6.\\n G\\nenerative AI can substantially \\nincrease labor productivity across the economy, but that will require investments to support workers as they shift work activities or change jobs.  Generative AI could \\nenable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth. However, workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world. \\n7.\\n T\\nhe era of generative AI is just \\nbeginning. Excitement over this \\ntechnology is palpable, and early pilots are compelling. But a full realization of the technology’s benefits will take time, and leaders in business and society still have considerable challenges to address. These include managing the risks inherent in generative AI, determining what new skills and capabilities the workforce will need, and rethinking core business processes such as retraining and developing new skills.Key insights\\n3 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Generative AI as a \\ntechnology catalyst\\nTo grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled \\nthe rise of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable Diffusion, and other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the result of significant levels of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine learning and deep learning. This investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many of the products and services we use every day. \\nBut because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech \\npowering our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use to surprise and delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, such as when AlphaGo, an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world champion Go player in 2016, were celebrated but then quickly faded from the public’s consciousness.\\nChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world \\nin a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to communicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. The latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the reorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.\\n1\\n4 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'How did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden \\nFor the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using \\nfoundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the billions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called deep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering generative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and perform more than one task. \\nFoundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across \\na broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. AI trained on these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer questions, and draft new content, among other tasks. \\nContinued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power \\nrequired to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a bottleneck in development.\\n2 Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-\\nsource community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to make AI more responsible, which could increase its costs. \\nNonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial \\nintelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five months of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative AI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. During the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 percent, albeit from a higher base. \\nThe rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have \\ndeveloped. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released a new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities.\\n3 \\nSimilarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 tokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—compared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023.\\n4 And in May \\n2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products.\\n5\\nFrom a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from tech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the continent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related companies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting for 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.\\n6 \\nGenerative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how knowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance. In the process, it could unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. We have used two overlapping lenses in this report to understand the potential for generative AI to create value for companies and alter the workforce. The following sections share our initial findings. \\n5 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Glossary\\nApplication programming interface (API) is a way to programmatically access (usually \\nexternal) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.\\nArtificial intelligence (AI)  is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require \\nhuman intelligence.Artificial neural networks (ANNs)  are composed of interconnected layers of software-based \\ncalculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and \\nprocess that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.\\nDeep learning  is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are \\nlayers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be \\ntrained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and audio.\\nEarly and late scenarios  are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The \\n“earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in \\nfaster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\\nFine-tuning  is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in \\na specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled data set, which \\nis much smaller than the data set the model was initially trained on. This additional training allows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found in the smaller data set.\\nFoundation models (FM)  are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of \\nunstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or \\nadapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, DALL ·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.\\nGenerative AI  is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that \\nearlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also \\nbe used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or positive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. For simplicity, when we refer to generative AI in this article, we include all foundation model use cases.\\nGraphics processing units (GPUs)  are computer chips that were originally developed for \\nproducing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning \\napplications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”\\nLarge language models (LLMs)  make up a class of foundation models that can process \\nmassive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions \\nof words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and LaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.\\n6 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Machine learning (ML)  is a subset of AI in which a model gains capabilities after it is trained \\non, or shown, many example data points. Machine learning algorithms detect patterns and \\nlearn how to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences, rather than by receiving explicit programming instruction. The algorithms also adapt and can become more effective in response to new data and experiences.\\nModality  is a high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.\\nProductivity  from labor is the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy.

Transformers do not rely on convolutions or recurrent neural networks.\\nTechnical automation potential  refers to the share of the worktime that could be automated. \\nWe assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through \\nan analysis of the component activities of each occupation. We used databases published by institutions including the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to break down about 850 occupations into approximately 2,100 activities, and we determined the performance capabilities needed for each activity based on how humans currently perform them.\\nUse cases  are targeted applications to a specific business challenge that produces one \\nor more measurable outcomes.

We define \\na “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specific business challenge, resulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the application of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the measurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such content and increases in revenue from the enhanced effectiveness of higher-quality content at scale. We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually when applied across industries. \\nThat would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we \\nnow estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock.

We modeled scenarios to estimate when generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—such as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up those occupations across the world economy.

However, as generative AI continues to develop and mature, it has the potential to open wholly new frontiers in creativity and innovation. It has already expanded the possibilities of what AI overall can achieve (please see Box 1, “How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases”).\\nIn this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: \\nbusiness function and modality.

Generative AI’s impressive command of natural-language processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.\\nIn 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about \\na fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly “read” vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task. \\nFollowing are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual \\nexpert in a handful of use cases.\\nIn addition to the potential \\nvalue generative AI can deliver in specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems.\\n13 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'How customer operations \\ncould be transformed\\nCustomer self-service interactions\\nCustomer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that \\ndelivers immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand voice regardless of customer language or location. \\nCustomer–agent interactions\\nHuman agent uses AI-developed call scripts and receives real-time assistance and suggestions for responses during phone conversations, instantly accessing relevant customer data for tailored and real-time information delivery. \\nAgent self-improvement\\nAgent receives a summarization of the conversation in a few succinct points to create a record of customer complaints and actions taken.\\nAgent uses automated, personalized insights generated \\nby AI, including tailored follow-up messages or personalized coaching suggestions. \\n14 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Customer operations\\nGenerative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, improving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service and enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent.\\n8 It also reduced agent attrition and \\nrequests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.\\nThe following are examples of the operational improvements generative AI can have for \\nspecific use cases:\\n —Cu\\nstomer self-service. Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and \\npersonalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or location of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via automated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of customer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be resolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts made by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI.

Generative AI could significantly reduce the \\ntime required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also \\nfacilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, writing style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can integrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly enhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, geographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into as many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the audience. Generative AI’s ability to produce content with varying specifications could increase customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a scale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.\\n —E\\nnhanced use of data. Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the \\nchallenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from different databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and varying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, synthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed marketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. Such tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product opportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and customer feedback.\\n —S\\nEO optimization. Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and \\nlower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical components such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, support specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to customers.\\n —P\\nroduct discovery and search personalization. With generative AI, product discovery \\nand search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images and speech, and deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, travel, and retail companies to improve their ecommerce sales by achieving higher website conversion rates. \\nWe estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.\\nOur analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn’t account for knock-on \\neffects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could provide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and better-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing higher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external channels and agencies.\\n18 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Generative AI could also change the way both B2B and B2C companies approach sales.

It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until clients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.\\nOur analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by approximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.\\nThis analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring \\nto sales functions. For instance, generative AI’s ability to identify leads and follow-up capabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring in additional revenue. Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI’s capabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased sales success.\\nGenerative AI as a virtual collaborator\\nIn other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, augmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. Its ability to rapidly digest mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. This can significantly speed up the process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact tasks. \\nGenerative AI could increase \\nsales productivity by 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.\\n19 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'How software engineering \\ncould be transformed\\nInception and planning\\nSoftware engineers and product managers use \\ngenerative AI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market trends, and existing system logs.\\nSystem design\\nEngineers use generative AI to create multiple IT architecture designs and iterate on the potential configurations, accelerating system design, and allowing faster time to market.\\nCoding\\nEngineers are assisted by AI tools that can code, reducing development time by assisting with drafts, rapidly finding prompts, and serving as an easily navigable knowledge base. \\nTesting\\nEngineers employ algorithms that can enhance functional and performance testing to ensure quality and can generate test cases and test data automatically.\\n20 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Software engineering\\nTreating computer languages as just another language opens new possibilities for software engineering.

This value would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent faster than those not using the tool.\\n9 An internal McKinsey empirical study of software \\nengineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment. \\nOur analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in \\nproductivity that generative AI could bring by improving code or enhancing IT architecture—which can improve productivity across the IT value chain.

Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with a value ranging from 10 to 15 percent of overall R&D costs.\\nFor example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI \\nfoundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others. \\n22 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'While other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply \\nAI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, can limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models that have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models optimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types of products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models lack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.\\nIn addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate \\ndesigns, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring: \\n —En\\nhanced design.

Using generative AI in generative design can \\nproduce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. Generative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial phases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing candidates. \\nWe also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI. \\nWhile we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, \\nwe did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product categories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the performance of individual companies but in economic growth overall.\\nBox 2\\nDeep learning surrogates\\nProduct design  in industries producing \\nphysical products often involves physics-\\nbased virtual simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Although they are faster than actual physical testing, these techniques can be time- and resource-intensive, especially for designing complex parts—running CFD simulations on graphics processing units can take hours. And these techniques are even more complex and compute-intensive when they involve simulations coupled across multiple disciplines (for example, physical stress and temperature distribution), which is sometimes called multiphysics.\\nDeep learning applications are now \\nrevolutionizing the virtual testing phase of the R&D process by using deep learning models to emulate (multi)physics-based simulations at higher speeds and lower costs. Instead of taking hours to run physics-based models, these deep learning surrogates can produce the results of simulations in just a few seconds, allowing researchers to test many more designs and enabling faster decision making on products and designs.\\n23 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Value potential by modality\\nTechnology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the \\nfrontier of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed and analyzed at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the initial stages of generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative AI is also heavily focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative AI can unlock across our use cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond text to text.\\nWhile most of generative AI’s initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent \\nadvances in generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI’s DALL ·E and Stable Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in audio, including voice and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications in marketing for generating advertising materials and other marketing content, and these technologies are already being applied in media industries, including game design. Indeed, some of these examples challenge existing business models around talent, monetization, and intellectual property.\\n11\\nThe multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative AI systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural engineering designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for a product. Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of LLMs trained on “design languages”). Once trained, such foundation models could increase productivity on a similar magnitude to software development.\\nValue potential by industry\\nAcross the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries.

Traditional AI and \\nadvanced-analytics solutions have helped companies manage vast pools of data across large numbers of SKUs, expansive supply chain and warehousing networks, and complex product catego -\\nries such as consumables. \\nIn addition, the industries are heavily \\ncustomer facing, which offers opportu -\\nnities for generative AI to complement previously existing artificial intelli -\\ngence. For example, generative AI’s ability to personalize offerings could optimize marketing and sales activities already handled by existing AI solutions. Similarly, generative AI tools excel at data management and could support existing AI-driven pricing tools. Applying gener -\\native AI to such activities could be a step toward integrating applications across a full enterprise.\\nGenerative AI is already at work in some \\nretail and CPG companies:\\nReinvention of the customer \\ninteraction patternConsumers increasingly seek customiza -\\ntion in everything from clothing and cos -\\nmetics to curated shopping experiences, personalized outreach, and food—and generative AI can improve that expe -\\nrience. Generative AI can aggregate market data to test concepts, ideas, and models. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms to suggest style choices to its custom -\\ners, has experimented with DALL ·E to visualize products based on customer preferences regarding color, fabric, and style. Using text-to-image generation, the company’s stylists can visualize an article of clothing based on a consumer’s preferences and then identify a similar article among Stitch Fix’s inventory. \\nRetailers can create applications that \\ngive shoppers a next-generation experi -\\nence, creating a significant competitive advantage in an era when customers expect to have a single natural-language interface help them select products. For example, generative AI can improve the process of choosing and ordering ingre -\\ndients for a meal or preparing food—imagine a chatbot that could pull up the most popular tips from the comments attached to a recipe. There is also a big opportunity to enhance customer value management by delivering personalized marketing campaigns through a chatbot. Such applications can have human-like conversations about products in ways that can increase customer satisfaction, traffic, and brand loyalty. Generative AI offers retailers and CPG companies many opportunities to cross-sell and upsell, collect insights to improve prod -\\nuct offerings, and increase their cus -\\ntomer base, revenue opportunities, and overall marketing ROI.\\nAccelerating the creation \\nof value in key areas Generative AI tools can facilitate copy writing for marketing and sales, help brainstorm creative marketing ideas, expedite consumer research, and accel -\\nerate content analysis and creation. The potential improvement in writing and visuals can increase awareness and improve sales conversion rates.\\nRapid resolution and enhanced \\ninsights in customer careThe growth of e-commerce also elevates the importance of effective consumer interactions. Retailers can combine existing AI tools with generative AI to enhance the capabilities of chatbots, enabling them to better mimic the interaction style of human agents—for example, by responding directly to a customer’s query, tracking or cancel -\\ning an order, offering discounts, and upselling. Automating repetitive tasks allows human agents to devote more time to handling complicated customer problems and obtaining contextual infor -\\nmation.\\nDisruptive and creative innovation\\nGenerative AI tools can enhance the process of developing new versions of products by digitally creating new designs rapidly. A designer can generate packaging designs from scratch or gen -\\nerate variations on an existing design. This technology is developing rapidly and has the potential to add text-to-video generation. \\nAdditional factors to consider\\nAs retail and CPG executives explore how to integrate generative AI in their operations, they should keep in mind several factors that could affect their ability to capture value from the technol -\\nogy. \\nExternal inference.

Foundation models \\nare a prime target for attack by hackers and other bad actors, increasing the vari -\\nety of potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks.\\nTo address these concerns, retail and \\nCPG companies will need to strate -\\ngically keep humans in the loop and ensure security and privacy are top considerations for any implementation. Companies will need to institute new quality checks for processes previous -\\nly handled by humans, such as emails written by customer reps, and per -\\nform more-detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes such as product \\ndesign.\\n27 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Spotlight: Banking\\n1 “ Building the AI bank of the future,” McKinsey, May 2021.\\n2 M cKinsey’s Global Banking Annual Review , December 1, 2022.\\n3 A khil Babbar, Raghavan Janardhanan, Remy Paternoster, and Henning Soller, “Why most digital banking transformations fail—and how to flip the odds,” McKinsey, \\nApril 11, 2023.\\n4 H ugh Son, “Morgan Stanley is testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot for its 16,000 financial advisors,” CNBC, March 14, 2023.Banks could realize substantial \\nvalue from generative AI \\nGenerative AI could have a significant \\nimpact on the banking industry,  gener -\\nating value from increased productivity of 2.8 to 4.7 percent of the industry’s annual revenues, or an additional $200 billion to $340 billion. On top of that impact, the use of generative AI tools could also enhance customer satis -\\nfaction, improve decision making and employee experience, and decrease risks through better monitoring of fraud and risk. \\nBanking, a knowledge and technolo -\\ngy-enabled industry, has already bene -\\nfited significantly from previously exist -\\ning applications of artificial intelligence \\nin areas such as marketing and custom -\\ner operations.\\n1 Generative AI applica -\\ntions could deliver additional benefits, especially because text modalities are prevalent in areas such as regulations and programming language, and the industry is customer facing, with many B2C and small-business customers.\\n2 \\nSeveral characteristics position the industry for the integration of genera -\\ntive AI applications:\\n —S\\nustained digitization efforts along \\nwith legacy IT systems. Banks have been investing in technology for decades, accumulating a significant amount of technical debt along with a siloed and complex IT architecture.\\n3\\n —L arge customer-facing workforces. \\nBanking relies on a large number of service representatives such as call-center agents and wealth management financial advisers. \\n —A\\n stringent regulatory environment.  \\nAs a heavily regulated industry, banking has a substantial number of risk, compliance, and legal needs.\\n —W\\nhite-collar industry. Generative \\nAI’s impact could span the organization, assisting all employees in writing emails, creating business presentations, and other tasks.\\nOn the move\\nBanks have started to grasp the poten -\\ntial of generative AI in their front lines and in their software activities. Early adopters are harnessing solutions such as ChatGPT as well as industry-specific solutions, primarily for software and knowledge applications. Three uses demonstrate its value potential to the industry:\\nA virtual expert to augment \\nemployee performanceA generative AI bot trained on pro -\\nprietary knowledge such as policies, research, and customer interaction could provide always-on, deep techni -\\ncal support. Today, frontline spending is dedicated mostly to validating offers and interacting with clients, but giv -\\ning frontline workers access to data as well could improve the customer experience. The technology could also monitor industries and clients and send alerts on semantic queries from public sources. For example, Morgan Stanley is building an AI assistant using GPT-4, with the aim of helping tens of thousands of wealth managers quickly find and synthesize answers from a massive internal knowledge base.\\n4 The \\nmodel combines search and content creation so wealth managers can find and tailor information for any client at any moment.One European bank has leveraged gen -\\nerative AI to develop an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) virtual expert by synthesizing and extracting from long documents with unstruc -\\ntured information. The model answers complex questions based on a prompt, identifying the source of each answer and extracting information from pic -\\ntures and tables.\\nGenerative AI could reduce the signifi -\\ncant costs associated with back-office \\noperations. Such customer-facing chatbots could assess user requests and select the best service expert to address them based on characteristics such as topic, level of difficulty, and type of customer. Through generative AI assistants, service professionals could rapidly access all relevant infor -\\nmation such as product guides and policies to instantaneously address customer requests. \\nCode acceleration to reduce tech \\ndebt and deliver software fasterGenerative AI tools are useful for soft -\\nware development in four broad cate -\\ngories. First, they can draft code based on context via input code or natural language, helping developers code more quickly and with reduced friction while enabling automatic translations and no- and low-code tools. Second, such tools can automatically generate, prioritize, run, and review different code tests, accelerating testing and increasing coverage and effectiveness. Third, generative AI’s natural-language translation capabilities can optimize the integration and migration of legacy frameworks. Last, the tools can review code to identify defects and inefficien-cies in computing. The result is more robust, effective code.\\n28 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Production of tailored \\ncontent at scaleGenerative AI tools can draw on existing documents and data sets to substan -\\ntially streamline content generation. These tools can create personalized marketing and sales content tailored to specific client profiles and histories as well as a multitude of alternatives for A/B testing. In addition, generative AI could automatically produce model documentation, identify missing docu -\\nmentation, and scan relevant regulatory updates to create alerts for relevant shifts. Factors for banks to consider\\nWhen exploring how to integrate gen -\\nerative AI into operations, banks can be mindful of a number of factors: \\n —T\\nhe level of regulation for different \\nprocesses. These vary from \\nunregulated processes such as customer service to heavily regulated processes such as credit risk scoring.\\n —T\\nype of end user. End users vary \\nwidely in their expectations and familiarity with generative AI—for example, employees compared with high-net-worth clients.\\n —I\\nntended level of work automation. \\nAI agents integrated through APIs could act nearly autonomously or as copilots, giving real-time suggestions to agents during customer interactions.\\n —D\\nata constraints.

This big potential reflects the resource-intensive process of dis -\\ncovering new drug compounds. Pharma companies typically spend approximate -\\nly 20 percent of revenues on R&D,\\n1 and \\nthe development of a new drug takes an average of ten to 15 years. \\nWith this level of spending and time -\\nline, improving the speed and quality \\nof R&D can generate substantial value. For example, lead identification—a step in the drug discovery process in which researchers identify a molecule that would best address the target for a potential new drug—can take several months even with “traditional” deep learning techniques. Foundation models and generative AI can enable organiza -\\ntions to complete this step in a matter of weeks. \\nGenerative AI use cases \\naligned to industry needs\\nDrug discovery involves narrowing the \\nuniverse of possible compounds to those that could effectively treat specific con -\\nditions. Generative AI’s ability to process massive amounts of data and model options can accelerate output across several use cases: \\nImprove automation of \\npreliminary screeningIn the lead identification stage of drug development, scientists can use founda -\\ntion models to automate the preliminary screening of chemicals in the search for those that will produce specific effects on drug targets. To start, thousands of cell cultures are tested and paired with images of the corresponding experi -ment. Using an off-the-shelf foundation model, researchers can cluster similar images more precisely than they can with traditional models, enabling them to select the most promising chemicals for further analysis during lead optimization. \\nEnhance indication finding\\nAn important phase of drug discovery involves the identification and prioriti -\\nzation of new indications—that is, dis -\\neases, symptoms, or circumstances that justify the use of a specific medication or other treatment, such as a test, pro -\\ncedure, or surgery. Possible indications for a given drug are based on a patient group’s clinical history and medical records, and they are then prioritized based on their similarities to established and evidence-backed indications. \\nResearchers start by mapping the \\npatient cohort’s clinical events and medical histories—including potential diagnoses, prescribed medications, and performed procedures—from real-world data. Using foundation models, researchers can quantify clinical events, establish relationships, and measure the similarity between the patient cohort and evidence-backed indications. The result is a short list of indications that have a better probability of success in clinical trials because they can be more accurately matched to appropriate patient groups.\\nPharma companies that have used this \\napproach have reported high success rates in clinical trials for the top five indi -\\ncations recommended by a foundation model for a tested drug. This success has allowed these drugs to progress smoothly into Phase 3 trials, significantly accelerating the drug development pro -\\ncess. Additional factors to consider\\nBefore integrating generative AI into operations, pharma executives should be aware of some factors that could limit their ability to capture its benefits:\\n —T\\nhe need for a human in the loop. \\nCompanies may need to implement new quality checks on processes that shift from humans to generative AI, such as representative-generated emails, or more detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes, such as drug discovery. The increasing need to verify whether generated content is based on fact or inference elevates the need for a new level of quality control.\\n —E\\nxplainability.  A lack of transparency \\ninto the origins of generated content and traceability of root data could make it difficult to update models and scan them for potential risks; for instance, a generative AI solution for synthesizing scientific literature may not be able to point to the specific articles or quotes that led it to infer that a new treatment is very popular among physicians. The technology can also “hallucinate,” or generate responses that are obviously incorrect or inappropriate for the context. Systems need to be designed to point to specific articles or data sources, and then do human-in-the-loop checking. \\n —P\\nrivacy considerations. Generative \\nAI’s use of clinical images and medical records could increase the risk that protected health information will leak, potentially violating regulations that require pharma companies to protect patient privacy. \\n30 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'In this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver \\nthrough use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology’s potential is much greater. As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional impact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy while also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at large. \\n31 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Technology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines \\nhave given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that would have taken years to do manually. \\nThese examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of \\nindividual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as a result of this technology than for older technologies.\\nThe McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation \\nof work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated that workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by The generative AI future \\nof work: Impacts on work activities, economic growth, and productivity \\n3\\n32 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'adapting technology that existed at that time, or what we call technical automation potential. \\nWe also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies could be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy. \\nTechnology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological \\ncapabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a sense of the pace and scale at which workers’ activities could shift over time.\\nLarge-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented. \\nConsider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a more macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of all workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people leave their jobs every month in the United States.\\n12 But this does not minimize the challenges \\nfaced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or societal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in demand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living. \\nAlso, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic \\nperspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\\nThe analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work \\nactivities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment the capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers whose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the future (see Box 3, “About the research”). \\nLabor productivity will \\nhave to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.\\n33 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Box 3\\nAbout the research\\nThis analysis builds on the methodology \\nwe established in 2017. We began by examining the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net breakdown of about 850 occupations into roughly 2,100 detailed work activities. For each of these activities, we scored the level of capability necessary to successfully perform the activity against a set of 18 capabilities that have the potential for automation (exhibit).\\nWe also surveyed experts in the \\nautomation of each of these capabilities to estimate automation technologies’ current performance level against each of these capabilities, as well as how the technology’s performance might advance over time. Specifically, this year, we updated our assessments of technology’s performance in cognitive, language, and social and emotional capabilities based on a survey of generative AI experts. Based on these assessments of the technical automation potential of each detailed work activity at each point in time, we modeled potential scenarios for the adoption of work automation around the world. First, we estimated a range of time to implement a solution that could automate each specific detailed work activity, once all the capability requirements were met by the state of technology development. Second, we estimated a range of potential costs for this technology when it is first introduced, and then declining over time, based on historical precedents. We modeled the beginning of adoption for a specific detailed work activity in a particular occupation in a country (for 47 countries, accounting for more than 80 percent of the global workforce) when the cost of the automation technology reaches parity with the cost of human labor in that occupation.Based on a historical analysis of various technologies, we modeled a range of adoption timelines from eight to 27 years between the beginning of adoption and its plateau, using sigmoidal curves (S-curves). This range implicitly accounts for the many factors that could affect the pace at which adoption occurs, including regulation, levels of investment, and management decision making within firms.\\nThe modeled scenarios create a \\ntime range for the potential pace of automating current work activities. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.\\nExhibit\\nOur analysis assesses the potential for technical automation \\nacross some 2,100 activities and 18 capabilities.\\nMcKinsey & CompanySource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis ~850 occupations ~2,100 activities assessed \\nacross all occupationsCapability requirements\\nSensory\\n• Sensory perception\\nCognitive \\n• Retrieving information \\n• Recognizing known \\npatterns and categories (supervised learning)\\n• Generating novel patterns \\nand categories \\n• Logical reasoning and \\nproblem solving \\n• Optimizing and planning• Creativity • Articulating/display output• Coordination with multiple \\nagentsExample: Retail activities\\n• Answer questions about \\nproducts and services\\n• Greet customers\\n• Clean and maintain work areas• Demonstrate product features• Process sales and transactions Examples\\nPhysical \\n• Fine motor skills and \\ndexterity\\n• Gross motor skills• Navigation • Mobility\\nNatural-language processing\\n• Understanding natural \\nlanguage\\n• Generating natural language\\nSocial \\n• Social and emotional \\nsensing\\n• Social and emotional \\nreasoning\\n• Social and emotional output Retail salespeople\\nFood and beverage service workersHealth practitioners  \\nTeachers\\n34 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Accelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work\\nBased on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to \\nmatch median human performance and reach top quartile human performance earlier than previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 6).

That said, the case for a minimum of eight years in our earliest scenario for reaching a global plateau in adoption accounts for the pace of adoption of other technologies that have arguably had a faster adoption potential—for example, social networking as a consumer technology that faced no barriers in enterprise change management. Our scenario also accounts for the significant role of small and midsize enterprises around the world, in addition to the challenges of incorporating and managing change in larger organizations. \\nIn addition, this analysis does not assume \\nthat the scale of work automation equates directly to job losses. Like other technologies, generative AI typically enables individual activities within occupations to be automated, not entire occupations. Historically, the activities in many occupations have shifted over time as certain activities are automated. However, organizations may decide to realize the benefits of increased productivity by reducing employment in some job categories, a possibility we cannot rule out. \\nGenerative AI is likely to \\nhave the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation.\\n39 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Generative AI’s potential impact on knowledge work \\nPrevious generations of automation technology were particularly effective at automating \\ndata management tasks related to collecting and processing data. Generative AI’s natural-language capabilities increase the automation potential of these types of activities somewhat. But its impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.\\nAs a result, generative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly \\nactivities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation (Exhibit 10). Our estimate of the technical potential to automate the application of expertise jumped 34 percentage points, while the potential to automate management  and develop talent increased from 16 percent in 2017 to 49 percent in 2023. \\nGenerative AI’s ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of activities and \\ntasks largely explains why automation potential has risen so steeply. Some 40 percent of the activities that workers perform in the economy require at least a median level of human understanding of natural language. \\nExhibit 10\\nGenerative AI could have the biggest impact on collaboration and the application \\nof expertise, activities that previously had a lower potential for automation.\\nMcKinsey & CompanyOverall technical automation potential, comparison in midpoint scenarios, % in 2023\\nNote: Figures may not sum, because of rounding.\\n1Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\\n2Applying expertise to decision making, planning, and creative tasks.\\n3Managing and developing people.\\n4Performing physical activities and operating machinery in unpredictable environments.\\n5Performing physical activities and operating machinery in predictable environments.\\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysis58.5\\n49.0\\n45.0\\n90.5\\n79.0\\n46.0\\n73.024.5\\n15.5\\n24.0\\n73.0\\n68.0\\n45.5\\n72.5Activity groups\\nDecision \\nmaking and collaboration\\nData \\nmanagement\\nPhysicalApplying expertise²\\nManaging³\\nInterfacing with \\nstakeholders\\nProcessing data \\nCollecting data\\nPerforming unpredictable \\nphysical work/uni2074\\nPerforming predictable \\nphysical work/uni2075Without generative AI/one.numrWith generative AI\\n40 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'As a result, many of the work activities that involve communication, supervision, \\ndocumentation, and interacting with people in general have the potential to be automated by generative AI, accelerating the transformation of work in occupations such as education and technology, for which automation potential was previously expected to emerge later (Exhibit 11). \\nExhibit 11\\nAdvances in technical capabilities could have the most impact on activities \\nperformed by educators, professionals, and creatives.\\nMcKinsey & CompanyImpact of generative AI on technical automation potential in midpoint scenario, 2023\\nNote: Figures may not sum, because of rounding.\\n¹Previous assessment of work automation before the rise of generative AI.\\n/two.numrIncludes data from 47 countries, representing about 80% of employment across the world.\\nSource: McKinsey Global Institute analysisEducator and workforce training\\nBusiness and legal\\nprofessionals\\nSTEM professionals\\nCommunity servicesCreatives and arts managementOﬃce supportManagersHealth professionalsCustomer service and salesProperty maintenance\\nHealth aides, technicians,\\nand wellness\\nProduction work\\nFood servicesTransportation services\\nMechanical installation\\nand repair\\nAgriculture\\nBuildersTotal54\\n62\\n57\\n65\\n53\\n87\\n44\\n43\\n57\\n38\\n43\\n82\\n78\\n49\\n67\\n63\\n53\\n6315\\n32\\n28\\n39\\n28\\n66\\n27\\n29\\n45\\n29\\n34\\n73\\n70\\n42\\n61\\n59\\n49\\n51Occupation groupWith generative AI\\nWithout generative AI¹Overall technical automation potential, \\ncomparison in midpoint scenarios, % in 2023Share of global \\nemployment,/two.numr %\\n4\\n5\\n3\\n3\\n1\\n9\\n3\\n2\\n10\\n4\\n3\\n12\\n5\\n3\\n4\\n21\\n7\\n100\\n41 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Labor economists have often noted that the deployment of automation technologies tends \\nto have the most impact on workers with the lowest skill levels, as measured by educational attainment, or what is called skill biased.

When combined with other technologies, automation overall could contribute 0.2 to 3.3 percent annually to productivity growth, assuming labor is redeployed at today’s productivity levels and not including general equilibrium eﬀects.Unit of analysis Function; industries; occupations\\nScope Forty-seven countries covering 80 percent of global workforce\\n57 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\", 'We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an \\nanalysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 47 countries representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed work activities.\\nEach detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be \\nautomated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. These assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry experts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from not required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the technical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity  for more details on the capabilities and the four \\nrequirement levels.\\n5\\nAssigning the required level of capabilities to activitiesWe used a machine learning algorithm to score the approximately 2,100 work activities in relation to the 18 performance capabilities. To train the algorithm, we devised a list of keywords with input from experts. The algorithm scores each activity by matching keywords from the capability to the activity title. These assessments were checked manually, and where we found anomalies, special requirements, or a need for nuance, we made adjustments—for example, in assessing the level of capabilities needed to navigate in extreme weather or on uneven surfaces and other unpredictable settings, or the different physical capabilities required by a kindergarten teacher compared with a middle school teacher.\\n1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines\\nOur adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity level for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.\\nTechnical feasibility\\nFor a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the required level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the performance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we updated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In our analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could be affected by generative AI:  \\n —N\\natural-language understanding\\n —N\\natural-language generation\\n —S\\nocial and emotional reasoning\\n —E\\nmotional and social output\\n —S\\nocial and emotional sensing\\n —C\\noordination with multiple agents\\n —G\\nenerating novel patterns or categories\\n —C\\nreativity\\n5 J obs lost, jobs gained: What the future of work will mean for jobs, skills, and wages , McKinsey Global Institute, November \\n28, 2017.\\n58 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', ' —L ogical reasoning and problem solving\\n —O\\nutput articulation or display\\n —S\\nensory perception\\nSolution development\\nWe also updated our estimates for how long it would take to develop a solution that could integrate automation technologies once technical feasibility was established, based on a series of expert interviews. The original estimates were developed by examining the development time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed automation solutions, including hardware and software solutions. \\nEconomic feasibility\\nOnce a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost of the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this calculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.\\nSolution cost evolution\\nBased on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. We estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that require a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. To be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only from very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality and efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to 20 percent for software.\\nIn our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs \\ndecline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. We triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in hardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to estimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software and accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution costs, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software’s low starting cost, annual reductions have little impact on final automation results.\\nWage evolution\\nWe model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 base) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for each country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which we have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage distribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We reclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate growth rate is applied.\\n59 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Adoption and deployment\\nAdoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors can hinder or enable the timing and the pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist on the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks to implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have varied levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.\\nTo incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-\\nknown and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting and technology forecasting.\\nF(t) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and f(t) is \\nthe corresponding rate of change.\\nThe function in our case also contains two key parameters: p parameter (the inherent \\ntendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and q parameter (the tendency of consumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary least square regression. In the absence of data, p and q parameter values from meta analyses can be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.\\nWe then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies \\nwe used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The fitted values of parameters p and q are consistent with other academic research. It takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 years in the latest scenario. \\n2. Work hours that could be automated\\nThe impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below for the technical automation potential and automation adoption:\\nImpact by occupation by scenario: Number of FTEs X % automation estimate by scenarioImpact by activity: Number of FTEs X time spent on activity per year\\n6 X percent automation \\nestimate by scenario Impact by occupation group\\n7 : Σ occupation  (Number of FTEs X percent automation estimate by \\nscenario)3. Impact of automation on productivity\\nWe used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor \\n6 F TEs whose job titles include these detailed work activities.\\n7 F or occupations included within the occupation group.\\n60 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'substitution effect but no other performance gains. Finally, we assumed that labor replaced \\nby automation will rejoin the workforce at the same level of productivity as today. We also assumed that additional output from automation will not decrease, even if the total number of FTEs declines as a result of demographic changes. \\nUnder the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption \\nby country as follows:\\nAdditional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity\\n  \\nThe additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the \\nproductivity impact of automation.\\n61 The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier', 'Acknowledgments\\nThe research underpinning this report was led by Michael Chui, an MGI partner in McKinsey’s \\nBay Area office; Eric Hazan, a senior partner in the Paris office; Roger Roberts, a partner in the Bay Area office; Alex Singla, a senior partner in the Chicago office; Kate Smaje and Alex Sukharevsky, senior partners in the London office; Lareina Yee, a senior partner in the Bay Area office; and Rodney Zemmel, a senior partner in the New York office. \\nThe project team included Dmitry Gafarov, Shivani Gupta, Dan Hababou, Leila Harouchi, Sonja \\nLindberg, Kerin Lo, Alexandre Pons, Alok Singh, Gurneet Singh Dandona, and Wilbur Wang. \\nThis research benefited immensely from the expertise and perspectives of many McKinsey \\ncolleagues.
