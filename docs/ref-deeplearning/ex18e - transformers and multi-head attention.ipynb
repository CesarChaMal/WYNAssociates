Tutorial 5: Transformers and Multi-Head Attention\n","\n","* **Author:** Phillip Lippe\n","* **License:** CC BY-SA\n","* **Generated:** 2023-03-24T16:02:55.114581\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will discuss one of the most impactful architectures of the last 2 years: the Transformer model.\n","Since the paper Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al. had been published in 2017,\n","the Transformer architecture has continued to beat benchmarks in many domains, most importantly in Natural Language Processing.\n","Transformers with an incredible amount of parameters can generate long, convincing essays, and opened up new application fields of AI.\n","As the hype of the Transformer architecture seems not to come to an end in the next years,\n","it is important to understand how it works, and have implemented it yourself, which we will do in this notebook.\n","This notebook is part of a lecture series on Deep Learning at the University of Amsterdam.\n","The full list of

What is Attention?\n","\n","The attention mechanism describes a recent new group of layers in neural networks that has attracted\n","a lot of interest in the past few years, especially in sequence tasks.\n","There are a lot of different possible definitions of \"attention\" in the literature,\n","but the one we will use here is the following: _the attention mechanism describes a weighted average\n","of (sequence) elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements' keys_.\n","So what does this exactly mean?\n","The goal is to take an average over the features of multiple elements.\n","However, instead of weighting each element equally, we want to weight them depending on their actual values.\n","In other words, we want to dynamically decide on which inputs we want to \"attend\" more than others.\n","In particular, an attention mechanism has usually four parts we need to specify:\n","\n","* **Query**: The query is a feature vector that describes what we are looking for in the sequence, i.e. what would we maybe want to pay attention to.\n","* **Keys**: For each input element, we have a key which is again a feature vector.\n","This feature vector roughly describes what the element is \"offering\", or when it might be important.\n","The keys should be designed such that we can identify the elements we want to pay attention to based on the query.\n","* **Values**: For each input element, we also have a value vector.\n","This feature vector is the one we want to average over.\n","* **Score function**: To rate which elements we want to pay attention to, we need to specify a score function $f_{attn}$.\n","The score function takes the query and a key as input, and output the score/attention weight of the query-key pair.\n","It is usually implemented by simple similarity metrics like a dot product, or a small MLP.\n","\n","\n","The weights of the average are calculated by a softmax over all score function outputs.\n","Hence, we assign those value vectors a higher weight whose corresponding key is most similar to the query.\n","If we try to describe it with pseudo-math, we can write:\n","\n","$$\n","\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_i, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_j \\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_j, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}, \\hspace{5mm} \\text{out} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\cdot \\text{value}_i\n","$$\n","\n","Visually, we can show the attention over a sequence of words as follows:\n","\n","<center width=\"100%\"

weights.\n","The softmax is not visualized for simplicity.\n","Finally, the value vectors of all words are averaged using the attention weights.\n","\n","Most attention mechanisms differ in terms of what queries they use, how the key and value vectors are defined,\n","and what score function is used.\n","The attention applied inside the Transformer architecture is called **self-attention**.\n","In self-attention, each sequence element provides a key, value, and query.\n","For each element, we perform an attention layer where based on its query,\n","we check the similarity of the all sequence elements' keys, and returned a different,\n","averaged value vector for each element.\n","We will now go into a bit more detail by first looking at the specific implementation of the attention mechanism\n","which is in the Transformer case the scaled dot product

respectively.\n","For simplicity, we neglect the batch dimension for now.\n","The attention value from element $i$ to $j$ is based on its similarity of the query $Q_i$ and key $K_j$,\n","using the dot product as the similarity metric.\n","In math, we calculate the dot product attention as follows:\n","\n","$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n","\n","The matrix multiplication $QK^T$ performs the dot product for every possible pair of queries and keys,\n","resulting in a matrix of the shape $T\\times T$.\n","Each row represents the attention logits for a specific element $i$ to all other elements in the sequence.\n","On these, we apply a softmax and multiply with the value vector to obtain a weighted mean\n","(the weights being determined by the attention).\n","Another perspective on this attention mechanism offers the

our layers with the intention of having equal variance throughout the model, and hence,\n","$Q$ and $K$ might also have a variance close to $1$.\n","However, performing a dot product over two vectors with a variance $\\sigma$ results\n","in a scalar having $d_k$-times higher variance:\n","\n","$$q_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma), k_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma) \\to

$Q$, $K$ and $V$ input to the attention layer).\n","The residual connection is crucial in the Transformer architecture for two reasons:\n","\n","1.\n","Similar to ResNets, Transformers are designed to be very deep.\n","Some models contain more than 24 blocks in the encoder.\n","Hence, the residual connections are crucial for enabling a smooth gradient flow through the model.\n","2.\n","Without the residual connection, the information about the original sequence is lost.\n","Remember that the Multi-Head Attention layer ignores the position of elements in a sequence,\n","and can only learn it based on the input features.\n","Removing the residual connections would mean that this information is lost after the first attention layer\n","(after initialization), and with a randomly initialized query and key vector,\n","the output vectors for position $i$ has no relation to its original input.\n","All outputs of the attention are likely to represent similar/same information,\n","and there is no chance for the model to distinguish which information came from which input element.\n","An alternative option to residual connection would be to fix at least one head to focus on its original input,\n","but this is very inefficient and does not have the benefit of the improved gradient flow.\n","\n","The Layer Normalization also plays an important role in the Transformer architecture as it enables faster\n","training and provides small regularization.\n","Additionally, it ensures that the features are in a similar magnitude among the elements in the sequence.\n","We are not using Batch Normalization because it depends on the batch size which is often small with Transformers\n","(they require a lot of GPU memory), and BatchNorm has shown to perform particularly bad in language\n","as the features of words tend to have a much higher variance (there are many, very rare words\n","which need to be considered for a good distribution estimate).\n","\n","Additionally to the Multi-Head Attention, a small fully connected feed-forward network is added to the model,\n","which is applied to each position separately and identically.\n","Specifically, the model uses a Linear$\\to$ReLU$\\to$Linear MLP.\n","The full transformation including the residual connection can be expressed as:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{split}\n","    \\text{FFN}(x) & = \\max(0, xW_1+b_1)W_2 +

block.\n","Usually, the inner dimensionality of the MLP is 2-8$\\times$ larger than $d_{\\text{model}}$,\n","i.e. the dimensionality of the original input $x$.\n","The general advantage of a wider layer instead of a narrow, multi-layer MLP is the faster, parallelizable execution.\n","\n","Finally, after looking at all parts of the encoder architecture, we can start implementing it below.\n","We

Learning rate warm-up\n","\n","One commonly used technique for training a Transformer is learning rate warm-up.\n","This means that we gradually increase the learning rate from 0 on to our originally specified\n","learning rate in the first few iterations.\n","Thus, we slowly start learning instead of taking very large steps from the beginning.\n","In fact, training a deep Transformer without learning rate warm-up can make the model diverge\n","and achieve a much worse performance on training and testing.\n","Take for instance the following plot by [Liu et al.\n","(2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03265.pdf) comparing Adam-vanilla (i.e. Adam without warm-up)\n","vs Adam with a warm-up:\n","\n","<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning-tutorials/raw/main/course_UvA-DL/05-transformers-and-MH-attention/warmup_loss_plot.svg\" width=\"350px\"></center>\n","\n","Clearly, the warm-up is a crucial hyperparameter in the Transformer architecture.\n","Why is it so important?\n","There are currently two common explanations.\n","Firstly, Adam uses the bias correction factors which however can lead to a higher variance in the adaptive\n","learning rate during the first iterations.\n","Improved optimizers like [RAdam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265) have been shown to overcome this issue,\n","not requiring warm-up for training Transformers.\n","Secondly, the iteratively applied Layer Normalization across layers can lead to very high gradients during\n","the first iterations, which can be solved by using Pre-Layer Normalization\n","(similar to Pre-Activation ResNet), or replacing Layer Normalization by other techniques\n","(Adaptive Normalization,\n","[Power Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07845)).\n","\n","Nevertheless, many applications and papers still use the original Transformer architecture with Adam,\n","because warm-up is a simple, yet effective way of solving the gradient problem in the first iterations.\n","There are many different schedulers we could use.\n","For instance, the original Transformer paper used an exponential decay
