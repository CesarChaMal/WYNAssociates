# Publication Checklist

## What editors look for

Editors want to publish good quality research that is of interest to their readers.

They will look at the cover letter, abstract, conclusion and references to judge if the submission is in scope for the journal.

Your manuscript is more likely to be accepted if it:

- is within the scope of the journal
- describes research that advances the field
- adds to an active research field
- is carefully prepared and follows the journal's 
- submission guidelines
- uses clear and concise language
- follows ethical standards

## Choosing a journal

Submitting manuscripts to an unsuitable journal is one of the most common reasons for early rejection and publication delays.

Check if a journal is right for you:

- read the aims and scope on the journal website
- consider if researchers in a related field might be interested in your study. If so, a journal that covers a broad range of topics may be best. If only researchers in your field are likely to want to read your study, then a field-specific journal may be best.
- verify if your target journal accepts the type of manuscript you want to publish
- look beyond the Impact Factor - it’s just one measure of a Journal's reputation
- consider the impact of other work published in the journal and whether your research is of a similar level.
- check if the "time to publication" is suitable to your needs

## Publication and funding

There are two publishing options, depending on the type of journal you choose.

### Open access

If you want your research to be freely available to everyone immediately on publication, or your funder or institution requires this, then you should choose a journal that offers open access. If you select this method, you or your funders will be responsible for paying an article processing charge (APC).

To find out more about funder and institutional open access requirements and getting help with APCs, see our Guide to open access funding.

### Subscription

Under this model, the cost of publishing is covered through journal subscription fees and you won’t need to pay an APC. Your research will only be seen by those subscribing to the journal.

## Submission guidelines

Follow the journal submission guidelines to increase your chances of success.

We recommend you read the guidelines as soon as you have chosen your target journal.

Write your manuscript according to the guidelines and ensure you include everything editors will expect to see.

Use the guidelines to find out about:

- word and character limits (title, running title, abstract, manuscript text)
- what sections to include
- formatting requirements
- references
- editorial policies
- file formats
- funding

## Writing quality

Help journal editors understand your manuscript, by making sure your writing is of good quality and clearly communicates what you have done.

Good-quality writing:

- increases the chances of acceptance for publication
- increases the impact of a manuscript in the research community
- accelerates understanding and acceptance of the research
- increases the faith of readers in the quality of the research

## Structure and layout

A well-structured article helps readers and editors understand your research.

Your manuscript should follow a simple structure under the following headings:

- title
- abstract
- introduction
- methods
- results
- discussion

Check your target journal’s submission guidelines to find more details about manuscript structure.

## Figures and tables

Avoid submission delays by ensuring that all your figures, tables and illustrations are annotated in line with the journal submission guidelines.

Legends and numbering must be consistent with any mentions in the text.

A well-designed table should have:

- clear and concise legends and captions
- sufficient spacing between columns and rows
- clear units
- font type and size are legible

## Maximize your visibility

You have every right to be proud of your work and your publication. So, what are the best ways to tell your peers and the wider community about it? There are exciting opportunities to promote your work with social media posts, interviews, or animated video abstracts. To help you get started, we've gathered a selection of tools and tactics here.
